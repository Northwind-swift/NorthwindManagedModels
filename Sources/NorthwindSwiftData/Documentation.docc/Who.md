NorthwindManagedModels is brought to you by
[Helge Heß](https://github.com/helje5/) via [ZeeZide](https://zeezide.de).
We like feedback, GitHub stars, cool contract work, 
presumably any form of praise you can think of.

## Supporting the Project

If you want to support the project, consider buying a copy of the
[“Code for SQLite3” application](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/code-for-sqlite3/id1638111010).
Or any other, you don't have to use them! 😀

Thank you!
